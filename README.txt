# CURSAT-ver.-2.0
A program to calculate rarefaction curves by bootstrap

This software is useful to address questions such as:
"how many sampling events are necessary to maximize the chance to sample all species that occur at a certain location?" or 
"how many sampling events are necessary to collect a representative sample of the species that occur at a certain location?"

Let's consider the following case: we know that 12 species occur at a certain location. We sampled that location 10 times and 
each time we found a certain number of species, according to the scheme here below. In the 12x10 matrix, species are a-l and sampling events are 1-10.
Presence and absence of each species in each sampling event is represented by 1 and 0, respectively.


   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

a  1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
b  1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
c  0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
d  0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
e  0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
f  1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
g  0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
h  1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
i  1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
j  0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
k  0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
l  1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 


CURSAT ver. 2.0 requires that you prepare an input file in this way:

1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0

and save it as a text file.

Once you run it, CURSAT ver. 2.0 will ask you how many columns (sampling events) you wish to consider (in this case 10).
Then, it will ask you to indicate the number of rows (species, in this case 12).
You will indicate how many bootstrap pseudoreplicates you wish to create.
Last things you need to input are the names of the input and output files.
By default, bootstrap replicates are saved in "boot.out" and they will look like this:

 The output file will look like this:

 6  12 
 7  12

 9  12 
 10  12 ....
 
You can import it in Excel or other statistical package and create nice box-plot graphs like the one in this repository (test 10 sampling events x 12 species.png), done using Statistica ver. 8(StatSoft, Inc).

The input file (test 10 sampling events x 12 species.txt) and the output file (test 10 sampling events x 12 species.out) used to write this README.txt are included in the repository, along with the bootstrap file (boot.out)
